  summary: List groups
  description: >-
    *NOTE* This feature is experimental and subject to change at any time. It may
    only be available on certain environments.


    A paginated list of groups.  Only groups the logged-in user belongs to will be returned.
    The returned groups are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated groups appearing first.


    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 groups.
    Each resource in the array is a separate group object and contains the full representation of the group, meaning additional requests to a group's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    #### Filtering


    You can optionally request that the response only include groups that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/groups/5c0571f4b146c900085f39a3/?filter[name]=lab.


    Groups may be filtered by their `name`.

    You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

  summary: Create a group
  description: >-
    *NOTE* This feature is experimental and subject to change at any time. It may

    Creates a new group.

    On the OSF, a group is a collection of users; examples are a lab group or a class.
    Users can add other users to groups, and then allow that group to access a project or several projects.

    #### Required

    Required fields for creating a group include:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name`


    Note: The creator is automatically made a manager of the group.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created group, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
