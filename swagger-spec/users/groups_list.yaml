get:
  summary: List user groups
  description: >-
    A paginated list of groups that a user belongs to.
    The returned groups are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated groups appearing first.

    If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all groups will be returned.
    Otherwise, only the groups that the logged-in user and the requested user both belong to will be returned.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 groups.
    Each resource in the array is a separate group object and contains the full representation of the group, meaning additional requests to a group's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    #### Filtering


    You can optionally request that the response only include groups that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/groups/?filter[name]=lab.


    Groups may be filtered by their `name`.

    You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).
